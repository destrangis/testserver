This is just an example of using Server Name Indication (SNI) on a HTTP server that chooses a certificate based on the hostname that the client wants to connect to. I wrote it just for illustration.

In order to use it, just generate certificates for hosts 'pantagruel' and 'badabec':

    $ . create_certificates

Add the hosts to your /etc/hosts file, so that they can be resolved by a web browser:

    127.0.0.1   badabec pantagruel

And then run the program:

    $ python3 server.py
    Listening on 0.0.0.0:8080

And launch the browser to http://pantagruel:8080 or http://badabec:8080, mind that the browser will complain about the self-signed certificates. Just create an exception for them.

You can also use the 'requests' module:

    >>> import requests
    >>> resp = requests.get("https://badabec:8080/", verify=False)
    >>> resp.text
    'All fine\r\n'
